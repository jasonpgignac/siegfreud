Siegfreud is an inventory management tool. In the short term, this means it is simply an inventory database application, nothing more, nothing less. In the long term, Siegfreud will be integrated with several other products to provide a front to end management tool for systems management, including imaging, software installation, license management, and disposal.

At this time, Siegfreud is functional, but not optimized for easy rollout.
